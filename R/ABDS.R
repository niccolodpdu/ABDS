#' ABDS: Tool Suite for Analyzing Biologically Diverse Samples
#'
#' We developed the ABDS tool suite specifically for analyzing biologically diverse samples. 
#' Mechanism-integrated group-wise pre-imputation is designed to recruit signature genes that represent informative missingness, 
#' a cosine-based one-sample test is extended to detect down-regulated signature genes, and a unified heatmap is designed to 
#' display multiple phenotypic groups. We discuss the methodological principles and demonstrate the effectiveness of three 
#' analytics tools, supported by comparative evaluations and biomedical showcases.
