# ABDS
ABDS: Tool Suite for Analyzing Biologically Diverse Samples

## Introduction
We developed the ABDS tool suite specifically for analyzing biologically diverse samples. Mechanism-integrated group-wise pre-imputation is designed to recruit signature genes that represent informative missingness, a cosine-based one-sample test is extended to detect downregulated signature genes, and a unified heatmap is designed to display multiple phenotypic groups. We discuss the methodological principles and demonstrate the effectiveness of three analytics tools, supported by comparative evaluations and biomedical showcases.
