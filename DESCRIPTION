Title: Tool Suite for Analyzing Biologically Diverse Samples
Version: 0.0.1.0
Description: We developed the ABDS tool suite specifically for analyzing biologically diverse samples. Mechanism-integrated group-wise pre-imputation is designed to recruit signature genes that represent informative missingness, a cosine-based one-sample test is extended to detect downregulated signature genes, and a unified heatmap is designed to display multiple phenotypic groups. We discuss the methodological principles and demonstrate the effectiveness of three analytics tools, supported by comparative evaluations and biomedical showcases. Implemented in open-source R scripts, ABDS tool suite complements rather than replace existing tools and will allow biologists to more accurately detect interpretable molecular signals among phenotypically diverse samples.
